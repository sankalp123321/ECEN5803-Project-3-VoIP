    HOW TO USE THESE FLAGS:
    
    in your code, you should wrap it with:
    
    #ifdef POST_STAB
    POST_STAB       // DO NOT FORGET THIS LINE
    
    #else // POST_STAB
    #endif // POST_STAB
    
    you MUST have the POST_STAB line right after the #ifdef
    and you must have the comments on the #else and #endif lines.

// This will change to something to break the build once stability is over.

/*
    HOW TO USE THESE FLAGS:
    
    For 04 product development, in your code, you should wrap it with:
    
    #ifdef POST03
    POST03       // DO NOT FORGET THIS LINE
    
      // 04 specific code

    #else // POST03
    #endif // POST03
    
    you MUST have the POST03 line right after the #ifdef
    and you must have the comments on the #else and #endif lines.
*/

// To build for 04 product, uncomment the next line. Do NOT check in this change. Once
// 03 and 04 fork, the ifdef's will be removed and this will be defined to something that
// breaks the build to make sure all of these are gone.


// Once M3 is over, this will change to something to break the build
