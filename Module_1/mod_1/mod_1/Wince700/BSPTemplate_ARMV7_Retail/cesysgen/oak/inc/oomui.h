Component Name:

oomui.h

Abstract:  

This header file defines the interface to the GWE component "oomui".
This component implements the user interface of the out-of-memory dialog, i.e.,
the dialog that appears when the device is nearly out of memory.

The "oomui" component works in conjunction with the "oom" component.  The
"oom" component is not replaceable, but it is removeable if you do not want 
any OOM dialog at all.

The OOM UI is based on two immortal windows: the OOM window and the Not
Responding window.  The OOM window is the window that gives the user of choice
of how to free up memory, for example, a list of windows that can be closed. The
Not Responding window is the window that comes up when a window cannot be closed
either because it is disabled or because it did not respond to the WM_CLOSE
message.  The Not Responding window is like a message box that can return one of
three values (via PostQuitMessage): REPLY_ENDTASK (forcibly terminate the task),
REPLY_CHOOSE (let the user choose another way to free memory, i.e., return to
the OOM Window), or REPLY_WAIT (continue to wait for the window to close).

Because these windows are immortal, the oomui component should never destroy
them. It should also never hide them, because the oom component is responsible
for this. When the user is done with one of these windows (e.g. when he presses
OK), the window procedure should simply call PostQuitMessage.

The OOM window is given information about the windows which are candidates to be
closed.  This information is passed in as an array of WINDOWINFO structures to
OomUI_SetWindowsInfo.  The first field is the hwnd.  The second field is the
name of the window.  (The OOM UI component cannot call GetWindowText because
this would send a window message to the window, and all other windows are frozen
when the OOM window is up.  The third field is fToBeClosed.  The oomui component
should set this field to TRUE if the user wants this window to be (politely)
closed. In this case, the oomui component should also call OomUI_CloseWindow on
the window. The fourth field is fToBeTerminated, which the oomui component
should set to TRUE if the window's process should be forcibly terminated.
