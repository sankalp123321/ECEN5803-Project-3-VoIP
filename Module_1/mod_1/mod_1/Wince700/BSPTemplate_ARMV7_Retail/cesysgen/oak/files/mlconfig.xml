    dbpath : fully qualified path and filename for the Media Library database

    WatchLocations have the following syntax:

    <WatchLocation DataSourceId="1" Root="\images\watched" Profile="local" Auto="1"/>
    <WatchLocation DataSourceId="1" Root="image" Profile="USBHDProfile" Auto="1"/>
    <WatchLocation DataSourceId="1" Root="music" Profile="USBHDProfile" Auto="1"/>
    <WatchLocation DataSourceId="1" Root="video" Profile="USBHDProfile" Auto="1"/>

    DataSourceId : ML_DS_FileSystem = 1 (See MLibDll.idl for enumeration)
    Root : root directory on the storage to watch
    Auto : Flag indicating automatic "watching" of this folder.
    Profile : Device Profile name. "local" for non-removable storage.
      "SDMemory", "SDHCMemory", "MMC", "RamDisk", "MSFlash", "HDProfile",
      "CDProfile", "PCMCIA", "USBHDProfile", "USBCDProfile", "USBFDProfile"

    The mount location for the specific attached storage will be used as a prefix
    for the "Root". In the 2nd example, since USBHDProfile is mounted at "\Hard Disk",
    the full watched path will be "\Hard Disk\image". For "local", the full path
    should be specified.

    Note that the "\My Documents" folder should not be used as a watch location
    as this can have conflicts with MTP and other application operations and will
    trigger excess file processing. An application-specific folder under the
    "\My Documents" folder can be used, e.g. "\My Documents\My Application\Watch".
    The path returned by the GetTempPath API should also not be used as this is
    where the Media Library stores intermediate files when processing metadata.
